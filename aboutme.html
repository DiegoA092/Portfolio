            <p class="presentacion-contenido-texto">
                Passionate about the intersection of technology and innovation, 
                I am a dedicated Mechatronic Engineer with 9 years of rich experience in the automotive industry. 
                My journey began at Autoliv, where I honed my skills as a Manufacturing Engineer in the 
                Project Launch area. This foundational year was pivotal, setting the stage for my subsequent 8 years at Bosch.

            <p class="presentacion-contenido-texto">     
                At Bosch, I initially contributed to HVAC motors, which soon led to a unique short-term assignment in Germany. 
                There, I began specializing in coolant valves, eventually becoming the Product Engineer responsible 
                for all coolant valve models across North America sharpening my project management, 
                supplier management and customer service skills.

            <p class="presentacion-contenido-texto">
                In January 2024, I transitioned from the automotive sector to embrace a new challenge: software development. 
                Currently being part of the Oracle ONE program and deepening my skills in IT support through a 
                Google IT Support certification, while simultaneously developing a comprehensive database project. T
                his career shift underscores my commitment to continuous learning and adapting to the dynamic tech landscape.

            <p class="presentacion-contenido-texto">
                I am actively seeking job opportunities that will allow me to expand my knowledge and complete 
                my transition to the software development sector.
